## Purpose
See https://www.dynatrace.com/hub/detail/oracle-connector-hub-signals-ingest/

## Ingest OCI logs into Dynatrace
With the OCI Log ingest function, OCI users can stream their logs directly into Dynatrace for troubleshooting and root cause analysis using DavisÂ® AI.  
This OCI function was created to work alongside the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure extension found on the Dynatrace Hub.

### Getting Started
**Note:** These actions must be done by a OCI tenancy administrator using the Oracle Cloud Shell or Oracle Code Editor.
Policies must also be configured in the OCI tenant to allow the Service Connector read metrics from the tenant. Users should do this using a group where the resource type is `serviceconnectors` before assigning the following policy: 
`Allow group <GROUP_NAME> to read metrics in tenancy`

6. Edit the `func.yaml` file, updating the `DYNATRACE_TENANT` and `DYNATRACE_API_KEY` environment variables with the url to your Dynatrace tenant and an api token with the `logs.ingest` scope.

7. Follow the instructions on the **Getting started** page under your application. Use the cloned repository instead of the example function in the instructions. This can be done in the code editor's terminal instead of a separate cloud shell.

8. After completeing the commands in the **Getting started** tab, you should see your image under the **Container registry** page.
